Instructions: Write a program that lets two players face off in a game of tic-tac-toe. I'm deliberately leaving this open ended - feel free to use whatever language or format you would like. 
It could be a command line game which prints a board and asks for a square number, a web based game, or ... whatever floats your boat!

To run the program, cd into the file and run bundle install. 

Next, enter ./bin/play 

May the best player win!
